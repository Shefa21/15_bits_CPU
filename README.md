## 🧠 15-bit CPU Design

Custom CPU design project for **CSE332: Computer Architecture & Organization**  
Under the guidance of **TNF Ma'am**  
Designed using a **customized 15-bit Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)**

---

## 📌 Overview

This project is a simplified 15-bit CPU built from scratch, focusing on core architecture and instruction execution.  
It simulates essential CPU operations including:

- Arithmetic & logic
- Data transfer
- Control flow

All powered by a **custom hardwired control unit**.

## 🧱 Features

- 🔢 15-bit Instruction Format  
- 🧮 Custom RISC-style ISA  
- 🗃 8 General-Purpose Registers (R0–R7)  
- 🔄 Single-cycle CPU (fetch → decode → execute)  
- 📤 Hardwired Control Unit  
- 🧠 ALU with arithmetic and logic ops  
- 💾 Separate instruction and data memory
